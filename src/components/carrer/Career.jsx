                <p>Our customers are mainly looking for a haircut with a personal touch. That is why it is so important for us to find a barber we could “click” with, a person that will tune in to the atmosphere of our salon and approach the Customer in a unique way. While cutting his hair, the barber should become the Customer’s friend whom he trusts his look entirely. Our Customers include different people with different social positions; so it is the barber who assumes all the responsibility for guessing their every wish, suggesting the right type of service and, of course, making them wish to become regulars.</p>
